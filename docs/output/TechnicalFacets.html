    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document contains consolidated Wf4Ever technical facets from all sources.</p>
    <p>
      These are mainly derived from the month 6 project deliverables documents, and need
      some review.  The intent is that facet information applied to technical 
      requirements can be used to isolate specific technical requirements applicable to 
      each of the project work areas.

A more social approach is required to really improve the collaboration of scientists. A prerequisite for this will be the modelling of the relationships and interactions between scientist and the scientific resources they collaborate with, as well as the community generated information, such as ratings, reviews and usage logs.</td>
