    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document contains consolidated Wf4Ever technical facets from all sources.</p>
    <p>
      These are mainly derived from the month 6 project deliverables documents, and need
      some consolidation work.  The intent is that facet information applied to technical 
      requirements can be used to isolate specific technical requirements applicable to 
      each of the project work areas.

Moreover, this information should be kept at different of abstractions, from the Research Object level to the level of the individual resources it encapsulates. Besides, the information should be detailed enough in order to support advanced operations with the Research Object, such as rolling back, fix and diagnose errors, comparison of Research Objects, etc.</td>

In general, two types of Research Object have been identified so far, a live or working Research Object and a published or archived Research Object. The former is expected to change frequently, while the latter is expected to be immutable. Hence, versioning will have to deal mostly with live Research Objects. Versions should have to consider changes at different levels, from the Research Object itself, such as its metadata, to the resources it encapsulates. Moreover, it should be possible to do automatic versioning of metadata (contributors, access privileges, modification date, etc.) to trace the provenance of these metadata. As a result, scientists will be able to access concrete versions of Research Objects and/or their associated resources, e.g., workflows, and to keep track of the evolution of those objects resulting from community efforts.</td>

Hence, scientists working with a Research Object may want to go back to a previous state of the Research Object, for instance, to retrace steps or to discard new changes introduced. For this requirement is not enough just to recover a previous state of the Research Object, but also being able to reproduce the steps (backwards) to move from one state to a previous one.</td>

So, in a similar situation as in the previous requirement, it may necessary to go back to a previous state of the Research Object. However, in addition to that, it should be feasible to make a diagnosis and potentially to fix the errors introduced. To this end, a complete log of the changes performed and how they were performed will be required.</td>

This can be useful, for example, in aiding scientists to understand how a Research Object has changed from a previous state, to analyze the transformations, or to find individual contributions to the Research Object. </td>

            <td>Collaborative construction requirement. Scientists should be able to work collaboratively in the construction of Research Objects. The involved members of the team may include scientists across disciplines with different expertise, and they may play different roles in such a collaborative process. For example, we could identify investigators (doing most of the scientific analysis), supervisors/advisors (the ones giving mostly scientific guidelines and revisions), domain expert advisors and others. Moreover, the collaboration among scientist may involve curation activities, following some predefined editorial process. That is, a process defining the operations and actions the scientists should follow to propose and to approve/reject changes, depending on their role and the state of the Research Object. Such information regarding the roles and process should be part of the collaboration model.</td>

The evolution and collaboration model should reflect the needs of the majority of scientists, e.g., as reported by Wf4Ever case studies, but at the same time it should allow proprietary extensions and refinements in particular application scenarios (e.g., different scientific domains). Usability can be maximized taking into account multiple metadata types. For instance, based on the NISO (National Information Standards Organization) recommendation, we could have structural metadata to represent, e.g., the physical and logical structure of a Research Object, descriptive metadata to represent information about the content of the Research Object, e.g., for discovery and identification purposes, administrative metadata to represent information that will help managing the Research Object, e.g., when and how it was created, technical information, etc.</td>

This ontology should reuse knowledge from the Research Object model, and it should be designed modularly to enable the integration of both models; and to ease its extension it in the future as needed. Among others, this ontology should allow the representation of different Research Object versions, of changes at different abstraction levels, including information of how they are applied, of the users and their roles, as well as the collaborative processes followed during the creation of Research Objects.</td>
