In general, two types of Research Object have been identified so far, a live or working Research Object and a published or archived Research Object. The former is expected to change frequently, while the latter is expected to be immutable. Hence, versioning will have to deal mostly with live Research Objects. Versions should have to consider changes at different levels, from the Research Object itself, such as its metadata, to the resources it encapsulates. Moreover, it should be possible to do automatic versioning of metadata (contributors, access privileges, modification date, etc.) to trace the provenance of these metadata. As a result, scientists will be able to access concrete versions of Research Objects and/or their associated resources, e.g., workflows, and to keep track of the evolution of those objects resulting from community efforts.</td>
