Versions should have to consider changes at different levels, from the Research Object itself, such as its metadata, to the resources it encapsulates. Moreover, it should be possible to do automatic versioning of metadata (contributors, access privileges, modification date, etc.) to trace the provenance of these metadata.

A more social approach is required to really improve the collaboration of scientists. A prerequisite for this will be the modelling of the relationships and interactions between scientist and the scientific resources they collaborate with, as well as the community generated information, such as ratings, reviews and usage logs.</td>

For example, we could identify investigators (doing most of the scientific analysis), supervisors/advisors (the ones giving mostly scientific guidelines and revisions), domain expert advisors and others. Moreover, the collaboration among scientist may involve curation activities, following some predefined editorial process. That is, a process defining the operations and actions the scientists should follow to propose and to approve/reject changes, depending on their role and the state of the Research Object. Such information regarding the roles and process should be part of the collaboration model.</td>
