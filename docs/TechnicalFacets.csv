"TF101","Repeatable","Use","RO","Include sufficient information for others to rerun the investigation at a later date. As a Reuser I want to run an existing workflow with new data.","D2.1, D3.1",""
"","","Use, Manage, Evaluate","Evolution, Collaboration","The evolution and collaboration model should provide the mechanisms to identify and characterize different versions of a Research Object and the resources it encapsulates. The goal is to enable scientists to access the same version of the services and data sources involved in the experiments described by a Research Object. This will in turn allow the repetition of the experiments, e.g., to verify or validate the results.","",""
"TF102","Reproducible","Use","RO","Include sufficient information for an independent investigator to reproduce the results, e.g. obtain the same results. As a Reviewer I want to rerun an investigation to validate the result.","D2.1",""

"","","Collaborate, Evaluate","RO, Collaboration","An important source of information about the Research Object supporting the collaboration of scientists is the justification of why and how particular decisions were made. Based on such justifications, scientists can better interpret a Research Object, its objective and speed up the collaborative work during the construction and adaptation of a Research Object. Hence, the should enable the representation and tracking of such justifications as the Research Object evolves.","D3.1",""

"","","Modify, Use","Evolution, Collaboration","Research Objects are subject to many different changes, especially because the resources they aggregate can be of a very dynamic nature, e.g., databases. As such, the evolution and collaboration model should enable the modelling of the transformations the Research Object goes through its lifetime.","",""

"TF111","Referenceable","Cite","RO","Means of identifying ROs. As a Publisher I want to provide references to ROs so that they can be cited.","D2.1, D3.1",""
"","","Cite","Evolution, Collaboration","The ability of representing different versions of a Research Object with the evolution and collaboration model, as noted above, will also play an important role supporting references to Research Objects, and the resources they encapsulate. In particular, the evolution and collaboration model should provide the means for the identification of such versions, which would enable their referencing as the Research Object evolves.","",""
"TF112","Versioning","Diagnose, View, Modify, Collaborate, Understand","Evolution, Collaboration","Providing roll-back to retrace steps, fix errors, diagnose errors. As a Re-user I want to see versions of a workflow to understand how it has evolved.","D2.1, D3.1",""
"","","Manage, Diagnose","Evolution, Provenance, Annotation","The evolution and collaboration model should allow keeping a complete track of the changes that the Research Object undergoes. The information to be modelled includes not only a representation about the changes themselves, but also about how those changes were applied (e.g., chronological order, dependencies between them); and possibly why they were conducted (e.g., argumentation).","",""

Hence, scientists working with a Research Object may want to go back to a previous state of the Research Object, for instance, to retrace steps or to discard new changes introduced.","",""
"TF114","Repairable","Diagnose, View, Understand, Repair","Evolution, Workflow","Providing roll-back to retrace steps, fix errors, diagnose errors. As a Re-user I want to see versions of a workflow to understand how it has evolved.","D2.1, D3.1",""
"","","Diagnose, View, Understand, Repair","Evolution. RO, Workflow","During the lifetime of the Research Object, it could happen that some errors were introduced while making changes. So, in a similar situation as in the previous requirement, it may necessary to go back to a previous state of the Research Object. However, in addition to that, it should be feasible to make a diagnosis and potentially to fix the errors introduced. To this end, a complete log of the changes performed and how they were performed will be required.","",""

"TF116","Comparison","Evaluate, Understand","RO, Evolution, Collaboration","One of motivations of modelling the evolution of Research Objects is to compare different versions of the Research Object, and in general to compare different states of the same Research Object or with similar Research Objects. This can be useful, for example, in aiding scientists to understand how a Research Object has changed from a previous state, to analyze the transformations, or to find individual contributions to the Research Object.","D3.1",""
"TF117","Collaboration","Create","RO, Collaboration","Scientists should be able to work collaboratively in the construction of Research Objects. The involved members of the team may include scientists across disciplines with different expertise, and they may play different roles in such a collaborative process.","D3.1",""
"TF118","Social","Collaborate, Share, Use, Evaluate","Collaboration","Current workflow systems have limited collaborative support for sharing and reusing workflows and related resources. In fact they focus only on making workflows available for sharing. A more social approach is required to really improve the collaboration of scientists. A prerequisite for this will be the modelling of the relationships and interactions between scientist and the scientific resources they collaborate with, as well as the community generated information, such as ratings, reviews and usage logs.","D3.1",""
"TF119","Attribution","Cite","Collaboration, RO","In order to encourage the collaboration of scientists, special attention has to be paid to credit assignment and recognition of individual contributions.

"TF124","Security","Sharing","Sharing, RO, Repository","Research Objects should have different access and security properties depending on user’s role, allowing policies such as making Research Objects (or only part of it) to be freely accessible to all users; permitting a finer-grained definition of access permissions to just a target group of users; and also allowing the definition of partial and temporal access permissions.","D3.1",""
"TF125","Info quality","Use","RO, Collaboration","Scientists are only willing to reuse and extend good quality, trustworthy and coherent scientific work. Hence, the collaboration model should allow keeping trace of relevant information about those aspects of Research Objects, such as authors, contributors, applications, process used for its creation, reviews, etc.","D3.1",""
