"TR1","UR2, UR19, UR20, UR21, UR24, UR26, UR27, UR37, UR40, UR44, UR46, UR48","Discovery, Recommendation","The recommender system must provide the necessary mechanisms in order to discover proactively the Research Objects that might be of interest to the user. This activity should be performed considering the following properties:
Safety. The recommender system should avoid recommendation flooding at all costs. 
Completeness. The recommender system should provide the wider as possible set of relevant Research Object. This property is particularly important since the recommender system will in some cases be used to provide an overview of the state of the art to new scientist.","D3.1","// (REC) Discoverable RO"
"TR2","UR2, UR3, UR24, UR27, UR37, UR40, UR48","Repurposeable, Recommendation","The recommender system must take into consideration the resources that compose a Research Object and not only Research Objects as a whole. Therefore, when making recommendations to a given user the system might suggest new Research Objects; or just resources that might a useful addition/alternative to the ones already aggregated by the Research Objects that the user is currently using or creating","D3.1","// (REC) Repurposeable RO"
"TR3","UR3, UR4, UR14, UR18, UR23, UR24, UR30, UR31, UR40, UR41, UR42","Alive","Research Objects are subject to many different changes, especially because the resources they aggregate can be of a very dynamic nature, e.g., databases. As such, the evolution and collaboration model should enable the modeling of the transformations the Research Object goes through its lifetime. In particular, the model should be flexible enough to cope with all the possible changes a Research Object can undergo.","D3.1","// (ECM) Alive RO"
"TR4","UR3, UR4, UR8, UR9, UR10, UR16, UR17, UR35, UR36, UR41, UR46, UR47","Referenceable","In order to encourage the collaboration of scientists in the construction of Research Objects, it is important to ensure that it is possible to reference those Research Objects. The evolution and collaboration model should provide the means for the identification of Research Objects and of the resources it encapsulates, which will enable referencing and citing not only the Research Object as a whole but also its individual parts.","D3.1","// (ECM) Referenceable RO"
"TR5","UR5, UR16, UR22, UR25","Historical","The evolution and collaboration model should allow keeping a complete track of the changes that the Research Object undergoes. The information to be modeled includes not only a representation about the changes themselves, but also about how those changes were applied (e.g., chronological order, dependencies between them); and possibly why they were conducted (e.g., argumentation). Moreover, this information should beAttribution kept at different of abstractions, from the Research Object level to the level of the individual resources it encapsulates. Besides, the information should be detailed enough in order to support advanced operations with the Research Object, such as rolling back, fix and diagnose errors, comparison of Research Objects, etc.","D3.1","// (ECM) Historical RO"
"TR6","UR16, UR41","Versioning","It should be possible to keep different versions of Research Objects. In general, two types of Research Object have been identified so far, a live or working Research Object and a published or archived Research Object. The former is expected to change frequently, while the latter is expected to be immutable. Hence, versioning will have to deal mostly with live Research Objects. Versions should have to consider changes at different levels, from the Research Object itself, such as its metadata, to the resources it encapsulates. Moreover, it should be possible to do automatic versioning of metadata (contributors, access privileges, modification date, etc.) to trace the provenance of these metadata. As a result, scientists will be able to access concrete versions of Research Objects and/or their associated resources, e.g., workflows, and to keep track of the evolution of those objects resulting from community efforts.","D3.1","// (ECM) Versioning"
"TR7","UR5, UR22, UR29, UR35","Comparison","One of motivations of modeling the evolution of Research Objects is to compare different versions of the Research Object, and in general to compare different states of the same Research Object or with similar Research Objects . This can be useful, for example, in aiding scientists to understand how a Research Object has changed from a previous state, to analyze the transformations, or to find individual contributions to the Research Object.","D3.1","// (ECM) Comparison"
"TR8","UR7","Attribution","In order to encourage the collaboration of scientists, special attention has to be paid to credit assignment and recognition of individual contributions. This includes, on the one hand a model for the characterization and identification of those resources, which would enable their citation and attribution in an easy and straightforward manner. And on the other hand, the detection of plagiarism. For the latter, an evolution and collaboration model would provide also some mechanisms to detect it, for example by using the changes in the Research Object.","D3.1","D3.1 lists this as “(ECM) Plagiarism”"
"TR9","UR11, UR22","Reliable, Annotation","An important source of information about the Research Object supporting the collaboration of scientists is the justification of why and how particular decisions were made. Based on such justifications, scientists can better interpret a Research Object, its objective and speed up the collaborative work during the construction and adaptation of a Research Object. Hence, the should enable the representation and tracking of such justifications as the Research Object evolves.","D3.1","// (ECM) Reliable RO"
"TR10","UR15","Recoverable","Research Objects can change many times during their lifetime. Hence, scientists working with a Research Object may want to go back to a previous state of the Research Object, for instance, to retrace steps or to discard new changes introduced. For this requirement is not enough just to recover a previous state of the Research Object, but also being able to reproduce the steps (backwards) to move from one state to a previous one.","D3.1","// (ECM) Roll-back"
"TR11","UR15","Repairable","During the lifetime of the Research Object, it could happen that some errors were introduced while making changes. So, in a similar situation as in the recoverable requirement, it may necessary to go back to a previous state of the Research Object. However, in addition to that, it should be feasible to make a diagnosis and potentially to fix the errors introduced. To this end, a complete log of the changes performed and how they were performed will be required.","D3.1","// (ECM) Fix and diagnose"
"TR12","UR19, UR27, UR34","Info quality, provenance","Scientists are only willing to reuse and extend good quality, trustworthy and coherent scientific work. Hence, the collaboration model should allow keeping trace of relevant information about those aspects of Research Objects, such as authors, contributors, applications, process used for its creation, reviews, etc.","D3.1","// (ECM) Quality and trustworthiness"
"TR13","UR20","Discovery, Recommendation","The recommender system should provide content-based recommendations based on the way that search and retrieving of scientific content is already performed by researchers, allowing search in fields such as authors, abstract, keywords, publication dates, etc.","D3.1","// (REC) Content-based"
"TR14","UR22, UR33","Visualization","The visualization tool for Collaboration Spheres has to present in a graphical fashion how Research Objects are connected by sharing different resources","D3.1","// (SHA) Visualization"
"TR15","UR26, UR27","Recommendation","The criterion for selecting the relevance and suitability of an item (either Research Object or resource) is shared among a group of individuals (researchers of the same scientific field, researchers that belong to a concrete lab, etc.); but is not necessarily valid outside this community. There is a need of means for tailoring specific recommendations in terms of certain policies at least for each use case, and in general for each research community that in the future wishes to make use of the recommender system.","D3.1","// (REC) Policy-based recommendation"
"TR16","UR28, UR38","Repeatable, Collaboration","The evolution and collaboration model should provide the mechanisms to identify and characterize different versions of a Research Object and the resources it encapsulates. The goal is to enable scientists to access the same version of the services and data sources involved in the experiments described by a Research Object. This will in turn allow the repetition of the experiments, e.g., to verify or validate the results.","D3.1","// (ECM) Repeatable RO"
"TR17","UR34, UR43, UR44","Recommendation, Collaboration","Current workflow systems have limited collaborative support for sharing and reusing workflows and related resources. In fact they focus only on making workflows available for sharing. A more social approach is required to really improve the collaboration of scientists. A prerequisite for this will be the modelling of the relationships and interactions between scientist and the scientific resources they collaborate with, as well as the community generated information, such as ratings, reviews and usage logs.","D3.1","// (ECM) Social approach"
"TR18","UR34, UR45","Recommendation","The recommender system must consider user feedback in order to improve its future recommendations.","D3.1","// (REC) User feedback"
"TR19","UR40, UR48","Cross-boundary, Recommendation","Recommender systems are inherently vertical and configured to provide recommendations in a single and specific domain. The cross-boundary dimension of Research Objects makes mandatory the provisioning of recommendation on the very same Research Objects following different recommendation heuristics for each scientific community or communities. That implies that the recommender system must be aware of the scientific community that the user belongs to; and secondly it must act in accordance.","D3.1","// (REC) Cross-Boundary adaptative"
"TR20","UR43","Collaboration","Scientists should be able to work collaboratively in the construction of Research Objects. The involved members of the team may include scientists across disciplines with different expertise, and they may play different roles in such a collaborative process. For example, we could identify investigators (doing most of the scientific analysis), supervisors/advisors (the ones giving mostly scientific guidelines and revisions), domain expert advisors and others. Moreover, the collaboration among scientist may involve curation activities, following some predefined editorial process. That is, a process defining the operations and actions the scientists should follow to propose and to approve/reject changes, depending on their role and the state of the Research Object. Such information regarding the roles and process should be part of the collaboration model.","D3.1","// (ECM) Collaborative construction"
"TR21","UR49","Security","Research Objects should have different access and security properties depending on user’s role, allowing policies such as making Research Objects (or only part of it) to be freely accessible to all users; permitting a finer-grained definition of access permissions to just a target group of users; and also allowing the definition of partial and temporal access permissions.","D3.1","// (SHA) Access and Security"

This activity should be performed considering the following properties:
Safety. The recommender system should avoid recommendation flooding at all costs. 
Completeness. The recommender system should provide the wider as possible set of relevant Research Object. This property is particularly important since the recommender system will in some cases be used to provide an overview of the state of the art to new scientist.","D3.1","// (REC) Discoverable RO"

"TR3","UR3, UR4, UR14, UR18, UR23, UR24, UR30, UR31, UR40, UR41, UR42","Alive","Research Objects are subject to many different changes, especially because the resources they aggregate can be of a very dynamic nature, e.g., databases. As such, the evolution and collaboration model should enable the modeling of the transformations the Research Object goes through its lifetime. In particular, the model should be flexible enough to cope with all the possible changes a Research Object can undergo.","D3.1","// (ECM) Alive RO"
"TR4","UR3, UR4, UR8, UR9, UR10, UR16, UR17, UR35, UR36, UR41, UR46, UR47","Referenceable","In order to encourage the collaboration of scientists in the construction of Research Objects, it is important to ensure that it is possible to reference those Research Objects. The evolution and collaboration model should provide the means for the identification of Research Objects and of the resources it encapsulates, which will enable referencing and citing not only the Research Object as a whole but also its individual parts.","D3.1","// (ECM) Referenceable RO"
"TR5","UR5, UR16, UR22, UR25","History","The evolution and collaboration model should allow keeping a complete track of the changes that the Research Object undergoes. The information to be modeled includes not only a representation about the changes themselves, but also about how those changes were applied (e.g., chronological order, dependencies between them); and possibly why they were conducted (e.g., argumentation). Moreover, this information should beAttribution kept at different of abstractions, from the Research Object level to the level of the individual resources it encapsulates. Besides, the information should be detailed enough in order to support advanced operations with the Research Object, such as rolling back, fix and diagnose errors, comparison of Research Objects, etc.","D3.1","// (ECM) Historical RO"
"TR6","UR16, UR41","Versioning","It should be possible to keep different versions of Research Objects. In general, two types of Research Object have been identified so far, a live or working Research Object and a published or archived Research Object. The former is expected to change frequently, while the latter is expected to be immutable. Hence, versioning will have to deal mostly with live Research Objects. Versions should have to consider changes at different levels, from the Research Object itself, such as its metadata, to the resources it encapsulates. Moreover, it should be possible to do automatic versioning of metadata (contributors, access privileges, modification date, etc.) to trace the provenance of these metadata. As a result, scientists will be able to access concrete versions of Research Objects and/or their associated resources, e.g., workflows, and to keep track of the evolution of those objects resulting from community efforts.","D3.1","// (ECM) Versioning"
"TR7","UR5, UR22, UR29, UR35","Comparison","One of motivations of modeling the evolution of Research Objects is to compare different versions of the Research Object, and in general to compare different states of the same Research Object or with similar Research Objects . This can be useful, for example, in aiding scientists to understand how a Research Object has changed from a previous state, to analyze the transformations, or to find individual contributions to the Research Object.","D3.1","// (ECM) Comparison"
"TR8","UR7","Attribution","In order to encourage the collaboration of scientists, special attention has to be paid to credit assignment and recognition of individual contributions. This includes, on the one hand a model for the characterization and identification of those resources, which would enable their citation and attribution in an easy and straightforward manner. And on the other hand, the detection of plagiarism. For the latter, an evolution and collaboration model would provide also some mechanisms to detect it, for example by using the changes in the Research Object.","D3.1","D3.1 lists this as “(ECM) Plagiarism”"
"TR9","UR11, UR22","Reliable, Annotation","An important source of information about the Research Object supporting the collaboration of scientists is the justification of why and how particular decisions were made. Based on such justifications, scientists can better interpret a Research Object, its objective and speed up the collaborative work during the construction and adaptation of a Research Object. Hence, the should enable the representation and tracking of such justifications as the Research Object evolves.","D3.1","// (ECM) Reliable RO"
"TR10","UR15","Recoverable","Research Objects can change many times during their lifetime. Hence, scientists working with a Research Object may want to go back to a previous state of the Research Object, for instance, to retrace steps or to discard new changes introduced. For this requirement is not enough just to recover a previous state of the Research Object, but also being able to reproduce the steps (backwards) to move from one state to a previous one.","D3.1","// (ECM) Roll-back"
"TR11","UR15","Repairable","During the lifetime of the Research Object, it could happen that some errors were introduced while making changes. So, in a similar situation as in the recoverable requirement, it may necessary to go back to a previous state of the Research Object. However, in addition to that, it should be feasible to make a diagnosis and potentially to fix the errors introduced. To this end, a complete log of the changes performed and how they were performed will be required.","D3.1","// (ECM) Fix and diagnose"
"TR12","UR19, UR27, UR34","Info quality, provenance","Scientists are only willing to reuse and extend good quality, trustworthy and coherent scientific work. Hence, the collaboration model should allow keeping trace of relevant information about those aspects of Research Objects, such as authors, contributors, applications, process used for its creation, reviews, etc.","D3.1","// (ECM) Quality and trustworthiness"
"TR13","UR20","Discovery, Recommendation","The recommender system should provide content-based recommendations based on the way that search and retrieving of scientific content is already performed by researchers, allowing search in fields such as authors, abstract, keywords, publication dates, etc.","D3.1","// (REC) Content-based"

"TR15","UR26, UR27","Recommendation","The criterion for selecting the relevance and suitability of an item (either Research Object or resource) is shared among a group of individuals (researchers of the same scientific field, researchers that belong to a concrete lab, etc.); but is not necessarily valid outside this community. There is a need of means for tailoring specific recommendations in terms of certain policies at least for each use case, and in general for each research community that in the future wishes to make use of the recommender system.","D3.1","// (REC) Policy-based recommendation"
"TR16","UR28, UR38","Repeatable, Collaboration","The evolution and collaboration model should provide the mechanisms to identify and characterize different versions of a Research Object and the resources it encapsulates. The goal is to enable scientists to access the same version of the services and data sources involved in the experiments described by a Research Object. This will in turn allow the repetition of the experiments, e.g., to verify or validate the results.","D3.1","// (ECM) Repeatable RO"
"TR17","UR34, UR43, UR44","Recommendation, Collaboration","Current workflow systems have limited collaborative support for sharing and reusing workflows and related resources. In fact they focus only on making workflows available for sharing. A more social approach is required to really improve the collaboration of scientists. A prerequisite for this will be the modelling of the relationships and interactions between scientist and the scientific resources they collaborate with, as well as the community generated information, such as ratings, reviews and usage logs.","D3.1","// (ECM) Social approach"
"TR18","UR34, UR45","Recommendation","The recommender system must consider user feedback in order to improve its future recommendations.","D3.1","// (REC) User feedback"
"TR19","UR40, UR48","Cross-boundary, Recommendation","Recommender systems are inherently vertical and configured to provide recommendations in a single and specific domain. The cross-boundary dimension of Research Objects makes mandatory the provisioning of recommendation on the very same Research Objects following different recommendation heuristics for each scientific community or communities. That implies that the recommender system must be aware of the scientific community that the user belongs to; and secondly it must act in accordance.","D3.1","// (REC) Cross-Boundary adaptative"
"TR20","UR43","Collaboration","Scientists should be able to work collaboratively in the construction of Research Objects. The involved members of the team may include scientists across disciplines with different expertise, and they may play different roles in such a collaborative process. For example, we could identify investigators (doing most of the scientific analysis), supervisors/advisors (the ones giving mostly scientific guidelines and revisions), domain expert advisors and others. Moreover, the collaboration among scientist may involve curation activities, following some predefined editorial process. That is, a process defining the operations and actions the scientists should follow to propose and to approve/reject changes, depending on their role and the state of the Research Object. Such information regarding the roles and process should be part of the collaboration model.","D3.1","// (ECM) Collaborative construction"
"TR21","UR49","Security","Research Objects should have different access and security properties depending on user’s role, allowing policies such as making Research Objects (or only part of it) to be freely accessible to all users; permitting a finer-grained definition of access permissions to just a target group of users; and also allowing the definition of partial and temporal access permissions.","D3.1","// (SHA) Access and Security"
