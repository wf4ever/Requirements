"UA1","comparator","to know details about the data used as input to a workflow execution","I can know under which conditions was the original data retrieved, and the provenance of that data itself.  It is extremely relevant to know the provenance/ conditions of your data in a sense these two factors are related with quality of the science involved in the workflow.",4,5,
,"re-user",,,4,,
,"evaluator",,,5,,
"UA2","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to know the details about the data transformations that take place during the workflow execution","I can check all the transitory data. For astronomers this is quite important since they are looking to see what happens when one upgrades properties of objects in catalogues, and how this updates propagates to other quantities.",4,5,
"UA3","comparator","to know the status of the decision points in the execution of a workflow","I can see the branches taken in a workflow execution and the rationale behind them",3,2,"OK as long as it does not affect the quality of the science"
,"re-user, evaluator",,,4.5,,
"UA4","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to move (back and forth) from different versions of the same RO/workflow","I can inspect their differences.  This is very relevant, as the different versions of the same workflow may lead to better quality of science.",4.5,4,
"UA5","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to navigate relevant metadata information by following the links among them and to have an advanced visualization of this information","I can have a more human-oriented presentation of and access to the metadata information. This is really important for the users since we are talking about visual influence over the user independently of his/her role; having all the data available with the touch of a click is a fundamental idea.",5,2.5,
"UA6","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to visually see the evolution of Ros/workflows over time","I can see how they change from version to version. A picture is worth a 1000 words, and this is something that is valuable for Astronomy.",5,5,
"UA7","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to express a (subjective) opinion about the quality of external data sources","I or my colleagues can use these external data sources with care.  This is very controversial matter, as assessing the quality of data/articles/software is quite subjective. (Users might have biased opinions about data/services that make this a very complicated matter.) However, overall the importance for science is huge, as good quality data / reliable services all improve science.",3,4.5,
"UA8","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to know the Quality of Service of external data sources","I can choose the most reliable ones among services of similar functionality.",3,4.5,"See UA7"
"UA9","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to reproduce a scientific experiment consistently.","I can obtain the same results if the inputs and transformations are the same.  This is very important; it means that if a workflow is clear enough to be reproducible and consistent, it saves time, and it is trustworthy.  It also means that if you fully understand it you can improve it. If methodologies become easily repeatable, the science results can be easily verified by independent teams leading to accuracy and quality.",5,5,
"UA10","comparator, re-user, evaluator","to debug a workflow","I can fix it if the results of their execution seem to be inconsistent, incomplete, etc.  This is very important, as this directly affects the quality of you final product",5,5,
